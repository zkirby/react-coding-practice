# Slider Prompt

![slider](./slider.png)

Build a slider component.

A slider component consists of the following requirements:

- [ ] The slider is divided into two sections - filled and unfilled - which are divided by a draggable bar.

- [ ] As the bar is dragged to the left or right, the filled section is expanded or contracted.

- [ ] The initial fill section can be set with a `percentFull` prop that is an integer from 0-100 representing the percent full the slider should be.

### Bonus

- [ ] Slider width should be able to be set dynamically.
