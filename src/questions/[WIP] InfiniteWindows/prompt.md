# Infinite Windows

![carousel](./carousel.png)

Build an infinite scrolling view of 'windows'.

This component should meet the following requirements:

- [ ] Should show no more than 10 windows at a time with windows being phased in and out depending on if the user scrolls up or down.
- [ ] Should use `api.getWindows({ cursor })` to fetch a given set of 10 windows.
- [ ] Should account for loading, null states, etc.
